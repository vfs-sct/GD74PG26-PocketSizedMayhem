# Pocket-Sized Mayhem  
Pocket-Sized Mayhem is a **3D isometric game** where you play as an alien trying to win an arcade game to get the right to conquer Earth. You’ll use tools like a **Mallet and Claw** to kill, capture criminals or help save civilians in a city that is full of chaos. **Capture two criminal bosses** before the city is destroyed and all the civilians are dead.
### Game Pillars
> 👽 **Simple**
> Gameplay, goals, and controls were designed to make the game simple to play. With clear objectives, minimal controls, and strong in-game feedback, players quickly understand what they need to do in the game. It’s a perfect fit for casual gamers of all ages.

> ⏩ **Fast-Paced**
> The chaos in the game keeps increasing over time, requiring the player’s constant attention as they must observe the city at all times. Quick reactions to kill criminals and find the boss are essential parts of the gameplay.

> 😆 **Humorous**
> The player has multiple ways to kill or capture criminals before chaos erupts in the game. Their creativity in combining weapons and using the environment to achieve their goals will result in humorous in-game feedback.

## Game Features
### The Mallet
Players use a mallet as their main weapon to punish criminals. It kills regular enemies in one hit, enforcers in two hits, and stuns bosses. The mallet breaks regular buildings and shakes landmark buildings, while making vehicles explode and destroying smaller props.
### Claw Machine
Players use a claw machine to grab and carry objects in the game. You can use the claw to pick up criminals, civilians, scattered pieces from broken buildings, and small items like vehicles and trees.
### The City
The map is a city inside an arcade machine, captured by Zorg, the creator of the game. The city will feature various types of NPCs, including:
- **Civilians** will generally run toward the shelter. If a criminal chases them, they will panic and flee in random directions.
- **Regular criminals** will head for the shelter and chase any civilians they see along the way.
- **Enforcers** patrol specific areas. If they spot a civilian, they will chase and try to kill them. Afterward, they return to their patrol route.
- **Bosses** are different: they spawn additional criminals, move quickly, dodge player attacks, and cause significant damage to the shelter if they get close. Bosses can only be stunned until civilians develop a bomb at the shelter. Dropping the bomb on the boss will kill it.
### Justice Point
Starting with 0 Justice points, players aim to earn the most points by the end of the game. Eliminating criminals by sending them to prison will increase the justice points. Killing criminals will increase the justice bar, but less so than capturing them. 

**Negative Points**
- Killing civilians
- Killing criminals that should have been captured alive and sent to prison.

**Positive Points**
- Stopping any crime
- Bringing civilians to the shelter

### Destruction
All buildings can be damaged but not completely destroyed, except for regular buildings which can be entirely demolished. Landmark buildings, prisons, and shelters cannot be damaged. Dropping a vehicle onto a building will destroy the building and cause the vehicle to explode.

> [!Note]
> 🚙 **Vehicles:** Non-damaged vehicles will explode if struck by a mallet or dropped from a height by the claw.
